### Advanced UX Features
- **Seamless Workflow**: Auto-generation when advancing steps (no extra clicks)
- **Animated Feedback**: Pulsing robot animations and visual feedback during AI generation
- **Smart Navigation**: Previous/Next buttons for completed steps, single "Accept & Continue" for progression
- **AI-Assisted Refinement**: Inline refinement system with natural language instructions
- **Rollback System**: Reset to previous steps with automatic clearing of dependent future work
- **Progress Protection**: Intelligent warnings when actions will affect future content

### Technical Features
- **Dual Interface**: Web UI + CLI for different workflows
- **Real-time Updates**: Responsive interface with loading states and success feedback
- **Structured AI Output**: Clean JSON generation using DSPy + Pydantic models
- **Async Architecture**: FastAPI backend with async SQLite storage

## Quick Start

## The Snowflake Method Steps

The [Snowflake Method](https://www.advancedfictionwriting.com/articles/snowflake-method/) is a proven approach to novel planning created by Randy Ingermanson:

1. **Story Idea** - One-sentence story summary
2. **Paragraph Summary** - Expand to full paragraph
3. **Character List** - Main characters and roles
4. **Plot Structure** - Story structure and major plot points
5. **Character Synopses** - One-page description per main character
6. **Detailed Synopsis** - Four-page story synopsis
7. **Character Charts** - Detailed character development
8. **Scene Table** - Scene-by-scene breakdown
9. **Character Arcs** - Individual character storylines
10. **First Draft** - Ready to write!

## Architecture

### Backend (`snowmeth/`)
- **FastAPI** - Async web framework
- **SQLAlchemy + SQLite** - Async database with JSON support
- **DSPy + OpenAI** - Structured AI content generation
- **Click** - CLI interface

### Frontend (`frontend/`)
- **React 18** - Modern component architecture
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe development
- **Vite** - Fast development and building
- **CSS Modules** - Component-scoped styling

### Development Workflow
```bash
# Start both servers
./scripts/start-dev.sh

# Check status
./scripts/status-dev.sh

# Stop servers
./scripts/stop-dev.sh

# Run tests
uv run pytest

# Lint and format
uv run ruff check && uv run ruff format
```
